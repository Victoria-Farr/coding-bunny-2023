        <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Som tags directly introduce content into the page. Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>History</header>
        <p>Some history about the development of HTML:<p>
          <ul>
            <li>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</li>
            <li>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</li>
            <li>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.</li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="HTML5">
        <header>HTML5</header>

        <p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
        
        <p>In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001.</p>
        
        <p>In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Example">
        <header>Example</header>
        <p>The following is an example of the classic DOCTYPE tag:</p>
          <code>< ! DOCTYPE html >
          </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Markup">
        <header>Markup</header>
        <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. </p>
        <p>HTML tags most commonly come in pairs, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
        <p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>
      </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
        <header>Elements</header>
        <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements.</p>
        <p>These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus:</p>
        <code>< p ></code>

        <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" and "end tag."</p>
        <p>The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags:</p>
        <code>< p > content < / p ></code>

        <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
        <p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this:</p>
        <code>< img src="example.com/example.jpg" ></code>

        <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element < p >, are optional. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Delivery">
        <header>Delivery</header>
          <p>HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.</p>

        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
not defined</code>
