	<h3>She was know as the “Witch of Pungo” - because crops and livestock never, ever, die on their own. Like, ever.</h3>
	<p>Grace White Sherwood (1660-1740), was the last person known to have been convicted of witchcraft in Virginia. A farmer, healer, and midwife, she was accused by her neighbors of transforming herself into a cat, damaging crops, and causing the death of livestock. </p>

	<h3>She was charged with witchcraft repeatedly…because she was surrounded by frickin' <i>idiots.</i></h3>
	<p><b>1697</b> - She was accused of casting a spell on a bull. A man named Richard Capps alleged that she had used a spell to cause the death of his bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement.</p>
